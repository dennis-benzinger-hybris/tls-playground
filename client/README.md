# TLS Playground Demo Clients

This TLS Playground component provides demo clients that make use of TLS certificates. This includes validation of server certificates and authentication with client certificates (mTLS).



## WIP Disclaimer

The demo clients are **work in progress**! They cannot be controlled with the tp command yet. And they are poorly documented.

That said, find some information on the existing demo clients here:

* [generic client](generic/)
* [Java client](java/)
